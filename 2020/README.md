# Advent Of Code
My approaches to solve every years puzzles.

### Setup & Usage
In order to run the solutions, simply navigate to the directory of the
corresponding year and follow the steps:
```sh
npm install
npm start
```
The setup was installed and all solutions of this specific year can be run.
`npm start` always runs the latest day-directory in watch mode.

For running a specific day:
```sh
DAY=day-01 npm run rerun
```
